# IMPORTANT:
For reasons of limiting file size, this folder on GitHub is empty. On your local PC/cluster, you need to populate
this folder using the 'Create_folder_structure.R' script (only needs to be run once), after the ISIMIP forcing files
are downloaded in the 'ISIMIPdownload/" folder and the lake characteristics files in the 'LakeCharacteristics/' folder.
