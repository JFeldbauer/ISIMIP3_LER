In this folder, download the the ISIMIP meteorological forcing files in the folder structure: '/scenario/gcm/'
The scenarios are calibration, historical, picontrol, ssp126, ssp370, and ssp585. Use the five ISIMIP3b GCMs for
all scenarios except 'calibration', where you should use the model calib_gcm (in our case, GSWP3-W5E5).

The models to use and scenarios to run are specified in 'Settings.R'
