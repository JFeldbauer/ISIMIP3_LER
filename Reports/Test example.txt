This folder can collect any reports that are written during workflow execution. It helps you to
track on what core which lakes are run and if any runs have already finished. This can be helpful
to discover where bottlenecks are, or what run is causing problems.

A report could show the following information:
Core:17,Method:LHC,number_of_runs:2000,Start_time:2023-09-29 11:11:58,Tasks:2,Lake_names:'Harp, TwoSisters'
Lake,Start_time,End_time
Harp,2023-09-29 11:11:58,2023-09-30 10:25:40
TwoSisters,2023-09-30 10:25:40,2023-10-01 05:54:22
